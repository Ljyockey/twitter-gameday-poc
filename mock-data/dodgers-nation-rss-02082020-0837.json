              "<p>Just before the new year, Dodger fans hearts were broken when fan favorite <a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-free-agency-news-rich-hill-signs-contract-with-al-team/2019/12/31/\">Rich Hill signed with the Minnesota Twins.</a> It&#8217;s February, and many still are not over the shock and sadness of Rich leaving. Rich has moved on with his new team but is still quite the ambassador. Rich was upbeat and still complimentary of former teammates and his former team in an interview with MLB Network Radio, linked here.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rich Hill joined the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twins?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Twins</a> <br />Now Kenta Maeda is joining the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twins?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Twins</a> <br />And life looks good in Minnesota<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Twins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Twins</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BombaSquad?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BombaSquad</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MaybeAHaiku?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MaybeAHaiku</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HFkv37zxbJ\">pic.twitter.com/HFkv37zxbJ</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; MLB Network Radio on SiriusXM (@MLBNetworkRadio) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLBNetworkRadio/status/1225599110155317249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 7, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<h2>Richie Talks Three Teams Improving</h2>\n<p>Rich Hill has always had a talent for diplomacy and saying the right things. He is a true professional who was candid on the idea that the <a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-mookie-betts-trade-currently-waiting-on-twins-may-be-reconfigured/2020/02/07/\">big moves that will (hopefully) soon be finalized</a>, were beneficial to all the teams involved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great for all teams, I believe. From the business side of Boston opening up their threshold, to the Dodgers gaining Mookie Betts and David Price, also to Minnesota getting Kenta Maeda. Also in Boston, they&#8217;re getting a young and fresh talent in Alex Verdugo. To me, it&#8217;s a win win win.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The funny thing is that Rich Hill has played for all three teams he is referencing. It is a true tip of the cap to his teammate Kenta Maeda and former teammate Alex Verdugo. He also notes that the Dodgers are obviously improving.</p>\n<h3>Enter to Win a Cody Bellinger Jersey!</h3>\n<div class=\"adace-slot-wrapper adace-shortcode-119376 adace-align-center\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<div class=\"adace-disclaimer\">\n\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"adace-slot\"><div class=\"adace_ad_5e3ec9cf440db\"><a class=\"e-widget no-button generic-loader\" href=\"https://gleam.io/OYxzW/cody-bellinger-dodgers-jersey-giveaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cody Bellinger Dodgers Jersey Giveaway</a>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://widget.gleamjs.io/e.js\" async=\"true\"></script>\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Angels In The Outfield (and the mound)</h2>\n<p>Two other former teammates of Rich (and former Dodgers) are ostensibly on the move in Joc Pederson and Ross Stripling. Rich Hill was quick to tip his cap to those former teammates as well.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The other side of this coin too is look at what the Angels have acquired in Joc Pederson and Ross Stripling. These are two guys that are All-Stars; incredible players. That just made the Angels contenders in the American League.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Look I know this is the type of thing he is supposed to say. With Rich Hill however, there is never a doubt in his sincerity. He was a tremendous teammate on the Dodgers and a supportive one, at that.</p>\n<h2>Rich Hill Builds Up His New Team</h2>\n<p>This is the part where I personally felt a little sad, but only selfishly. Rich Hill went on to build up his new team and talk World Series aspirations.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m excited from a baseball fan&#8217;s standpoint to see how everything is going to develop over the 2020 season, but also as a member of the Twins for our opportunity to win the World Series. We just increased our chances greatly by gaining Kenta Maeda. Some of these guys may get overlooked but the body of work they&#8217;ve been able to compile over the last four years that I&#8217;ve been around them is incredible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wow. Talk about talking up Kenta Maeda. This is not as far-fetched as one might think. Kenta Maeda as a starter can be lights out in the right situation. In the AL, anything can happen.</p>\n<h2>Cap Tip To Our Old Friend Rich Hill</h2>\n<p>Listen to the rest of the interview. Any time you can listen to Rich Hill talk, your day is better. He goes on to discuss his excitement for the 2020 season and looking forward to giving everything he can. For Dodger fans, this is an obvious notion. Rich Hill gave us 101% of himself, and we&#8217;ll always root him to do well.</p>\n"

Then we would have to figure out Florida housing, make that move, and just on and on and on of these things going through my mind of what I would have to do within days because ya know report dates are next week.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The full read is absolutely interesting and worth your time. But we thank Jesica for giving fans a small glimpse into the life of a baseball family.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"fasc-button fasc-size-xlarge fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium fasc-style-bold\" style=\"background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-jesica-and-matt-beaty-the-truly-wed-game/2019/08/12/\">NEXT: &#8220;The Truly Wed Game&#8221; with Matt and Jesica Beaty</a></p>\n"

However, the writing was on the wall as his time ticked down in Boston. As much as he wanted to stay in Bean Town &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/1940944\">a place he considers his home</a> &#8212; he was also eager to test the free agent market after not getting a contract extension offer he felt was worthy of his talents.</p>\n<p>Hershiser spoke on the feelings that come with leaving a team you want to be with but knowing it was coming.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think he&#8217;s already been playing through this for a while because he turned down Boston in a long term deal. So mentally, he&#8217;s already thought about putting on another uniform, getting to know another travelling secretary, having a new trainer, having new teammates. So he&#8217;s mentally gone through that.</p>\n<p>When I went from the Dodgers to the Cleveland Indians, I still wanted to be a Dodger but there was no job available for me so I had to seek other employment. I think this is not going to be as big a shock to him. It took half a season to look down at my chest and see &#8216;Indians&#8217; and not see &#8216;Dodgers&#8217; and think &#8216;oh my gosh, this is my team.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"adace-slot-wrapper adace-shortcode-119376 adace-align-center\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<div class=\"adace-disclaimer\">\n\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"adace-slot\"><div class=\"adace_ad_5e3ec9cf66f53\"><a class=\"e-widget no-button generic-loader\" href=\"https://gleam.io/OYxzW/cody-bellinger-dodgers-jersey-giveaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cody Bellinger Dodgers Jersey Giveaway</a>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://widget.gleamjs.io/e.js\" async=\"true\"></script>\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>One of the million-dollar (<a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-mookie-betts-rejects-red-sox-extension-offer-padres-in-mix-for-trade/2020/01/30/\">or $420M over 12 years</a>) questions has been whether or not Los Angeles can make a run as re-signing or extending Betts to a long-term deal.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week on Dodgers Nation&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/mookie-betts-and-david-price-to-la-pederson-maeda-out-blue-heaven-podcast/2020/02/05/\"><em>Blue Heaven Podcast</em></a>, I opined that Betts being with the Dodgers at the start of spring training instead of coming over at a later time would be key in him building chemistry with his new teammates, and with that, a love for the organization.</p>\n<p><em>Bulldog</em> agreed with that idea.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The difference between getting ready for a game in July, and getting ready for spring training games on a daily basis is huge. To have that 20-minute meeting before you workout every day &#8212; to get to know your teammates, your manager, the whole organization, the introductions &#8212; everything that you learn about an organization really comes in spring training.</p>\n<p>So to be able to acquire a player and go into a Dave Roberts spring training and Andrew Friedman meetings, the prep that they go through, the chemistry things they do during spring training together &#8230; it is a huge transition boost.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mookie Betts is an MLB superstar for a reason. He&#8217;s a big personality guy and he&#8217;s bringing it, along with his talents to LA for that #HollywoodLifestyle. Thankfully he&#8217;ll have time to introduce that personality in the more relaxed setting that comes at Camelback Ranch.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"fasc-button fasc-size-xlarge fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium fasc-style-bold\" style=\"background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-radio-host-says-mookie-betts-trade-is-the-good-news-los-angeles-needed/2020/02/06/\">NEXT: Dave Vassegh Thinks Betts is Coming To LA at the Perfect Time</a></p>\n"

They made switch prospects. Or they could be removed from the equation altogether. However, reports are that Minnesota is very interested in acquiring Kenta Maeda from Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Even if Minnesota is out, another key element to consider in a Boston/Los Angeles swap is the relationship between Dodgers President of Baseball Operations Andrew Friedman and Red Sox Chief Baseball Officer Chaim Bloom. Bloom worked with Friedman back in their Tampa Bay Rays days, adding an element of familiarity that could play up in assuring that a deal gets done.</p>\n<div class=\"adace-slot-wrapper adace-shortcode-119376 adace-align-center\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<div class=\"adace-disclaimer\">\n\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"adace-slot\"><div class=\"adace_ad_5e3ec9cf74dc9\"><a class=\"e-widget no-button generic-loader\" href=\"https://gleam.io/OYxzW/cody-bellinger-dodgers-jersey-giveaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cody Bellinger Dodgers Jersey Giveaway</a>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://widget.gleamjs.io/e.js\" async=\"true\"></script>\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Of course, this three-team deal isn&#8217;t the only trade that&#8217;s on hold.

My favorite part is that it alternates lefty and righty hitters throughout the lineup. With the big contract that A.J. Pollock was signed to last season, I fully expect him to be the regular left fielder. Gavin Lux is one of the top prospects in baseball, was untouchable this off-season and made the playoff roster after being called up in September. He should be the starting second baseman and should NOT be platooned to start the season. They will also have Will Smith at the Major League level for the whole season.</p>\n<p>For the first part of the season I do see Pollock and Seager flip-flopping based on the pitcher. If Seager improves his approach then I would hope to see him batting 2nd but Muncy is so much better at working a count and getting a walk.</p>\n<h2>If They Platoon &#8211; Against Right Handers</h2>\n<p>My hope is that the Dodgers don&#8217;t platoon much but it could be used in some cases. The Dodgers seem to love messing with the lineup even if the players are basically the same.

Other potential moves include putting Bellinger at first base with Taylor in center field with Kiké at second base. Luis Rengifo can play all over and is a switch hitter.</p>\n<h2>Summary &#8211; Lots of Options</h2>\n<p>Not to pick on Joc Pederson, but I am glad he is not the leadoff hitter for the Dodgers anymore. I wanted him fifth or sixth in the order. With Mookie Betts, the Dodgers have a legitimate leadoff option and I believe Gavin Lux could also find himself at the top of the order later in the season. The lineup has more options to be more balanced. This starts to matter in the later innings as opponents can no longer use the lefty type specialists (<a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-joe-kelly-talks-health-concerns-with-new-3-batter-rule-in-mlb/2020/02/04/\">3 batter minimum</a>) to get just one batter unless it is the last batter of the inning. When the Dodgers would have 2-3 lefties in a row a team could bring in their lefty specialist to get them out. With a good mixture in the lineup the specialist is less likely to appear.</p>\n<p>The Dodgers, with Betts and full years from Lux and Smith, should have the best offense in the National League. The bigger hope is that they can improve in the playoffs. How many bad at-bats happened in the 2019 post-season for the Dodgers? Adding one elite hitter like Betts will give the rest of the lineup more opportunities and should make them better. If Lux can slash .280/.380/.500 then that will take the team way above and beyond.</p>\n<p>There is a lot to be excited about with the 2020 Dodgers&#8217; offense. This should be fun.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"fasc-button fasc-size-xlarge fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium fasc-style-bold\" style=\"background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-world-series-odds-improve-drastically-after-mookie-betts-trade/2020/02/05/\">NEXT: Dodgers World Series Odds Improve Drastically After Mookie Betts Trade</a></p>\n"

In case you missed it, a trade between the Dodgers and Angels is in the works that would <a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-news-ross-stripling-reportedly-included-in-pederson-deal-to-angels/2020/02/05/\">include Ross Stripling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-joc-pederson-reportedly-traded-to-angels-in-separate-deal/2020/02/04/\">Joc Pederson heading to Orange County for prospects</a>.</p>\n<p>Now an added twist to the hold up could be Pederson&#8217;s pending arbitration hearing, at least in terms of the Dodgers/Angels deal. Ken Rosenthal added fuel to that fire.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Another factor in holdup of trade announcements, per sources: Joc Pederson’s arbitration hearing is today. Pederson is part of separate deal from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dodgers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dodgers</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Angels?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Angels</a>. He wanted $9.5M, LAD offered $7.75M. Decision likely would come within 24 hours of hearing’s conclusion (cont.).</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/1225454969014423557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Rosenthal <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/1587470/2020/02/06/rosenthal-three-team-mookie-betts-trade-held-up-may-be-adjusted-over-medical-review/\">expanded on that thought</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s unclear why Pederson’s hearing would cause a delay. Perhaps the Dodgers simply needed to get through it before trading him. Another possibility is that the Angels want to know his salary before finalizing terms with the Dodgers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the <a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/breaking-news-dodgers-sign-max-muncy-to-three-year-extension/2020/02/06/\">Dodgers agreed to an extension with Max Muncy</a> earlier on Thursday, the stage is set for an awkward hearing between Pederson and LA representatives. Rumors of a third party unbiased lawyer to help smooth out the process between the two parties.</p>\n<div class=\"adace-slot-wrapper adace-shortcode-119376 adace-align-center\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<div class=\"adace-disclaimer\">\n\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"adace-slot\"><div class=\"adace_ad_5e3ec9cf8629b\"><a class=\"e-widget no-button generic-loader\" href=\"https://gleam.io/OYxzW/cody-bellinger-dodgers-jersey-giveaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cody Bellinger Dodgers Jersey Giveaway</a>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://widget.gleamjs.io/e.js\" async=\"true\"></script>\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Once a 2020 contract can be agreed upon, then perhaps the deal with the Angels can continue, even before the Betts/Price trade moves forward. Earlier reports had the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/1224882016925241344\">Pederson deal contingent on the completion of the Betts trade</a>. On Thursday evening, USA Today scribe Bob Nightengale confirmed as much.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The only hold-up in the Joc Pederson/Ross Stripling trade to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Angels?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Angels</a> for 3 prospects is the Mookie Betts/David Price trade. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dodgers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dodgers</a> can&#39;t trade Pederson until they know they have Betts; which is held up by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RedSox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RedSox</a>&#39;s concerns over pitcher Brusdar Graterol&#39;s medicals.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Bob Nightengale (@BNightengale) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BNightengale/status/1225564341279260678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>The results of the Pederson case is expected to be resolved by Friday.

He first focused in on Price.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t just throw away David Price &#8230; to bring some depth back to the rotation after you lose [Hyun-Jin] Ryu and [Kenta] Maeda and Rich Hill. The youngsters coming up, it kind of protects them &#8212; and you know, the fact that David Price even only had 21-25 starts at a time over the last few years, that&#8217;s OK when you&#8217;re a Dodger because of the depth and the talent and the way they really protect people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;ve already had one <a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-mlb-analyst-likes-david-price-in-sunny-los-angeles/2020/02/05/\">MLB analyst loving the idea of Price pitching on the west coast</a> against the NL West, and Hershiser shared the same sentiment</p>\n<blockquote><p>You&#8217;d have to go back a decade to find a losing season for David Price. Yes his ERA has escalated, but his strikeouts to innings is still at a high. His ability to throw strikes is at a high, so he will be able to live in the strike zone more &#8230; so if you&#8217;re talking about a guy that strikes out more than a batter an inning already with people that know him in a tougher division, in a tougher ballpark, and you move him to the National League West with the big ballparks, it&#8217;s gonna be an upgrade.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The narrative of the NL West has always been that teams have struggled to score runs, especially with the large fields like Chase Field, Dodger Stadium, and whatever they&#8217;re calling that place in San Fransisco these days.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Small sample size…</p>\n<p>…but David Price lifetime at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dodger?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dodger</a> Stadium 19.2IP, 1.83ERA including the World Series clincher in 2018.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Steve Mason (@VeniceMase) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VeniceMase/status/1225203279392473090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 5, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>In his career against National League opponents, Price has a 15-12 record with a fine 3.42 ERA over 244.2 innings.

In the wake of the Mookie Betts trade that also brought pitcher David Price aboard, the city can&#8217;t wait for baseball season to get underway.</p>\n<p>For a long time, David Vassegh has covered the Dodgers in the greatest city in the world. Therefore, he can provide a pretty good gauge of the mood and temperature immediately following the trade.</p>\n<p>He joined MLB Network to talk about what the mood is like.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;This is the good news that Los Angeles has sorely needed.&quot; &#8211; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/THEREAL_DV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@THEREAL_DV</a> on the reported trade for Mookie Betts and David Price. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MLBTonight?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MLBTonight</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zeuWDweCap\">pic.twitter.com/zeuWDweCap</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MLBNetwork/status/1224916213383532544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 5, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Notably, Vassegh mentions that this was the big sports distraction of happiness the city can use. It&#8217;s when you read stuff like this that you realize, sports can provide an outlet during tough times.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is good news that Los Angeles has sorely needed since a week ago Sunday with the tragic helicopter accident that had Kobe Bryant and his daughter in it. But that is real life, this is sports. It&#8217;s a great distraction and Los Angeles is really excited that this really has come to fruition. Where Mookie Betts is coming to Los Angeles, and David Price. They&#8217;re so excited, I just got off the air doing &#8216;Dodger Talk&#8217; and Andre Ethier called into the show. That&#8217;s how excited everyone is.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While no one is suggesting that the Dodgers made the move due to the tragic events of the Bryant crash, it really couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time. The city of Los Angeles loves the Dodgers, and baseball season is about to begin. To bring a superstar and exciting starting pitcher to an already star-studded roster definitely will have people waking up in the morning excited. It gives them something positive to think about when they start their day.</p>\n<div class=\"adace-slot-wrapper adace-shortcode-119376 adace-align-center\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<div class=\"adace-disclaimer\">\n\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"adace-slot\"><div class=\"adace_ad_5e3ec9cf91af6\"><a class=\"e-widget no-button generic-loader\" href=\"https://gleam.io/OYxzW/cody-bellinger-dodgers-jersey-giveaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cody Bellinger Dodgers Jersey Giveaway</a>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://widget.gleamjs.io/e.js\" async=\"true\"></script>\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Equally important, it brings an entirely new feel to baseball season beginning; which is just days away if you count pitchers and catchers reporting as that threshold.</p>\n<p>Props to the Dodgers, and everyone involved who made this possible.

Rosenthal had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Red Sox projected [Graterol] more as a reliever than as a starter, according to sources involved with the discussions. As a result of that valuation, the Sox might ask for an additional player and/or money to bridge the gap, though it is unclear whether the player would come from the Twins or Dodgers, sources said.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Graterol would have been moving from the Twins to Boston as Kenta Maeda would head from Los Angeles to Minnesota.</p>\n<div class=\"adace-slot-wrapper adace-shortcode-119376 adace-align-center\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<div class=\"adace-disclaimer\">\n\t\t</div>\n\t<div class=\"adace-slot\"><div class=\"adace_ad_5e3ec9cfa4da9\"><a class=\"e-widget no-button generic-loader\" href=\"https://gleam.io/OYxzW/cody-bellinger-dodgers-jersey-giveaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cody Bellinger Dodgers Jersey Giveaway</a>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://widget.gleamjs.io/e.js\" async=\"true\"></script>\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>As this trade is held up, so too is the Joc Pederson/Ross Stripling trade to Anaheim. On Tuesday Rosenthal reported that a Pederson deal is contingent on the Dodgers acquiring Mookie Betts. Officially.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Joc Pederson would go from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dodgers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Dodgers</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Angels?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Angels</a> if blockbuster is completed, source tells The Athletic.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ken_Rosenthal/status/1224882016925241344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 5, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Once whispers of the snag started to emerge on Wednesday, questions about the health of Alex Verdugo and/or David Price soon followed. Price, of course, missed most of the second half of 2019 after undergoing a surgical procedure to remove a cyst in his left wrist (throwing side). And Verdugo&#8217;s season ended in August after lingering back and lower body issues shut him down.</p>\n<p>However, reports are that both are healthy and have been cleared medically for this transaction.</p>\n<p>So as it stands, this appears to be more of a hiccup over a full-blown stop to the deal. A new iteration of the trade may not change too many moving parts, but more so where they&#8217;re headed.</p>\n<p>Speculation has seen Maeda heading straight to Boston along with one more mid-level prospect from LA. Rosenthal also mentioned above that Minnesota may still be involved and send a different prospect to Boston.</p>\n<p>When you have this many bodies <em>and</em> cash moving around, there is an added level of caution for all sides.</p>\n<h3>UPDATE</h3>\n<p>An added twist to the hold up could be Joc Pederson&#8217;s arbitration hearing, at least in terms of the Dodgers/Angels deal. <a href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-with-joc-pederson-salary-arbitration-looming-angels-trade-also-on-hold/2020/02/06/\">More on this here</a>.</p>\n<p>Dodgers Nation will continue to monitor the situation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"fasc-button fasc-size-xlarge fasc-type-flat fasc-rounded-medium fasc-style-bold\" style=\"background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://www.dodgersnation.com/dodgers-walker-buehler-is-beyond-hyped-to-be-teammates-with-price-betts/2020/02/05/\">NEXT: Walker Buehler is Beyond Hyped to be Teammates With Price, Betts</a></p>\n"
